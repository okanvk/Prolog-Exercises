date(D,M,2001) = date(D1,may,Y1).

D = D1
M = may
Y1 = 2001

can easily match

otherwise
date(D,M,2001) = date(D1,M1,1444).

don't match because third argument 2001 and 1444 don't match.

date(X,Y,Z) = point(X,Y,Z)

don't match because functor names are different.


date(D,M,2001) = date(D1,may,Y1),date(D,M,2001) = date(15,M,Y).

D = D1, D1 = 15, M = may, Y1 = Y, Y = 2001


Matching Rules:

  (Structure)
  If S and t ARE STRUCTURES THEN THEY MATCH ONLY Ä°F:
    S and T have the same principal functor,
    All their corresponding components match.

  (Constant)
  If S and T are constatns then S and T match only if they are the same object and 


  (Variable)
  If S variable and T is anything,then they match,and S is instantiated to T, or T variable , S is anything then vice-versa

    X = point(1,1) : At this point X instantiated to Structure.

    A = point(4,Y) : At this point A instantiated to Structue

    point(2,3) = point(2,Z) : They have same functor,and 2=2  AND 3 = Z so Z is 3.

/*
vertical(seg(point(1,1),point(1,2))).
True : Because first point first argument and second point first argument satisfy


horizontal(seg(point(1,2),point(1,Z))).
Z should be 2 because Z instead of Y1 and first structure has Y1 value 2.

Are there any vertical segments that start at the point (2,3) ?

vertical(seg(point(2,3),P)).

answer : point(2,_912). _912 means can be anything in second argument but first argument must 2.

Is there a segment that is both vertical horizontal

vertical(seg(point(X,Y),point(X,Y))).
  
  True.
